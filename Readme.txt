- When saving the percipitation value for a grid cell, the date should be saved in UTC format. Currently it is being saved in UK format.
- The UI is not the apparent focus of this coding exercise. Therefore, it is only scaffolded to provide basic functionality, and there is minimal error handling. 
	Furthermore, the data display table only displays the first 1000 records. In a production system, this would be setup with proper pagination.
- In order to expedite this assessment, no unit tests have been added.
